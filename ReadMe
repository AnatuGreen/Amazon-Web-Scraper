- After we created our api routes, we decided to publish to the net but we decided that everyone that wants to use the api should get their own api keys so we removed our our key and created a function to allow users enter their own api keys.

- In order to allow people to add their api keys before using our api, we will add a parameter at the beginning of our endpoints
